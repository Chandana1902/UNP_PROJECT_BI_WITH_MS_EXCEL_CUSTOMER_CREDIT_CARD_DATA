# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA
As an MBA student from Bhavan's Vivekananda College, I collaborated with three of my peers on a data analysis project in association with UNP.We were given a large and complex dataset as the foundation for our work.Our goal was to analyze, filter, and present the data in a clear, insightful format.Using Excel tools like PivotTables and slicers, we streamlined data exploration.Interactive dashboards were created to visualize trends, comparisons, and key metrics.Slicers allowed users to navigate and filter data effortlessly in real-time.The project helped us develop strong analytical thinking and decision-making skills.It also enhanced our ability to work as a team under a structured deadline.As MBA students, we applied our academic learning to practical, real-world data challenges.This experience gave us valuable exposure to data-driven business decision-making. The project challenged us to think critically and work collaboratively under real-world conditions.It significantly improved our Excel proficiency and understanding of data presentation.
Overall, it was a hands-on experience that bridged academic knowledge with practical application. It also improved our skills in Excel automation, charting, and report presentation.Overall, the project was a great blend of learning, collaboration, and practical application.
